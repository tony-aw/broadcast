# Introduction

&nbsp;

## 🗺️Overview

The 'broadcast' `r fa("r-project")` - package, as the name suggests, performs "broadcasting" (similar to broadcasting in the 'Numpy' module for 'Python').

In the context of operations involving 2 (or more) arrays, "broadcasting" refers to recycling array dimensions **without** allocating additional memory, which is considerably **faster** and **more memory-efficient** than R's regular dimensions replication mechanism.

Please read the article "Broadcasting explained" for a more complete explanation of what "broadcasting" is.

&nbsp;

At its core, the 'broadcast' package provides 3 functionalities, all 3 related to "broadcasting":

&nbsp;

First, 'broadcast' provides functions for element-wise outer computations between any 2 arrays.  
These are similar to base R's `outer()` function, but using broadcasting, which is faster and more efficient than the mechanism employed by `outer()`.  
The outer-like functions provided by 'broadcast' are optimised for a large set of relational-, arithmetic-, Boolean-, and string operations.  
These functions have clear broadcasting rules, making it easy to accurately predict the dimensions of the result.

&nbsp;

Second, 'broadcast' provides the `bind_array()` function, which is a broadcasted and enhanced form of the fantastic `abind::abind()` function:

-   `bind_array()` allows for broadcasting (obviously), whereas `abind::abind()` does not.
-   `bind_array()` is significantly **faster** and uses **less memory** than `abind::abind()`.
-   `bind_array()` also differs from `abind::abind()` in that it can handle recursive arrays properly; `abind::abind()` unlists everything to atomic arrays, ruining the structure.

&nbsp;

Third, 'broadcast' provides several generic functions for broadcasting:

-   `bcapply()`: a broadcasted apply-like function that works on pairs of arrays.
-   `bc_ifelse()`: a broadcasted `ifelse()` function. Broadcasts between the `yes` and `no` arguments.

&nbsp;

Additionally, 'broadcast' includes the `acast()` function, for casting/pivoting an array into a new dimension. Roughly analogous to `data.table::dcast()`, but for arrays.

&nbsp;


## 🤷🏽Why use 'broadcast'

**Efficiency**

Broadcasting dimensions is faster and more memory efficient than replicating dimensions.  
Efficient programs use less energy and resources, and is thus better for the environment.  
As a favoured language for the sciences, `r fa("r-project")` should not throw away an opportunity to become more efficient.

The `Benchmarks` show that 'broadcast' has a somewhat similar speed as equivalent operations in 'Numpy'.

&nbsp;

**Convenience**

Have you ever been bothered by any of the following while programming in `r fa("r-project")`:

 - Receiving the "non-conformable arrays" error message in a simple operation when it intuitively should work?
 - Receiving the "Error: cannot allocate vector of size" error message because `r fa("r-project")` unnecessarily allocates too much memory?
 - Trying to perform a simple operation on all possible combinations, only to find out you need nested loops and/or grid expansions to do something that should be *very* simple?
  - having to store and re-assign attributes when type-casting arrays?
 - `outer()` being slow and consuming way too much memory?
 - `abind()` being too slow, saying arrays are not conformable, and/or coercing recursive arrays to character arrays?
 - having to convert arrays to data.frames and then back to arrays (which wastes memory and other resources), *just* to be able to cast arrays?

If you answered "YES" to any of the above, 'broadcast' may very well be the `r fa("r-project")` - package for you.

&nbsp;



**Minimal Dependencies**

Besides linking to 'Rcpp', 'broadcast' does not depend on, vendor, link to, include, or otherwise use any external libraries; 'broadcast' was essentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.

Not using external libraries brings a number of advantages:

 - **Avoid dependency hell**: Every dependency that is added to a software package increases the likelihood of something breaking (AKA "dependency hell"). 'broadcast' thus avoids this.
 - **Avoid wasting resources for translations**: Using libraries from other languages, such as 'xtensor' ('C++') or 'Numpy' ('Python') means that - at some point - one needs to convert between the structure of `r fa("r-project")` to that of the other language, and vice-versa, which wastes precious time, memory, and power. 'broadcast' requires no such translations of structures, and is therefore much less wasteful.
 - **Ensure consistent behaviour**: Using libraries from other languages also means one cannot always guarantee consistent behaviour for some operations. For example: both 'Numpy' and 'xtensor' have only limited support for missing values, whereas `r fa("r-project")` supports missing values for both atomic and recursive array/vector types (except type of 'Raw'). Since 'broadcast' does not rely on external libraries, it can ensure behaviour that is consistent with the rest of `r fa("r-project")`.
