Description: Implements simple broadcasted operations for atomic and recursive arrays.
		Besides linking to 'Rcpp',
		'broadcast' does not depend on, vendor, link to, include, or otherwise use any external libraries;
		'broadcast' was essentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.
		The broadcasted implementations include, but are not limited to, the following.
		  1) A more efficient and broadcasted version of `abind()`, for binding arrays along an arbitrary dimension;
		  2) Relational operations (like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`; can also take into account Machine precision);
		  3) Arithmetic operations (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, "gcd", `^`, `pmin()`, `pmax()`);
		  4) Boolean combiner operations (like `&`, `|`, `xor()`, "nand");
		  5) String distance, (in)equality, and concatenation operations;
		  6) A Broadcasted implementation of `ifelse()`;
		  7) A Broadcasted apply-like function;
		The broadcasted implementations strive to minimize computation time and memory usage
		(which is not just good for computer efficiency, but also for the environment).
