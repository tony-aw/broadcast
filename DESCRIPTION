Description: Implements simple broadcasted operations for atomic and recursive arrays.
		Besides linking to 'Rcpp',
		'broadcast' does not depend on, vendor, link to, include, or otherwise use any external libraries;
		'broadcast' was essentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.
		The implementations available in 'broadcast' include, but are not limited to, the following.
		  1) A faster, more memory efficient, and broadcasted version of `abind()`,
		  for binding arrays along an arbitrary dimension;
		  2) A set of broadcasted outer()-like functions,
		  optimised for a large set of relational-, arithmetic-, Boolean-, and string operations.
		  3) A Broadcasted implementation of `ifelse()`;
		  4) A Broadcasted apply-like function;
		  5) The `acast()` function, for casting/pivoting an array into a new dimension.
		The functions in the 'broadcast' package strive to minimize computation time and memory usage
		(which is not just good for efficient computing, but also for the environment).
