Description: Implements simple broadcasted binary operations,
		for atomic and recursive arrays.
		All operations are element-wise binary operations
		(i.e. involving only 2 arrays at a time).
		Besides linking to 'Rcpp',
		'broadcast' does not depend on, vendor, link to, or otherwise use any external libraries;
		'broadcast' was essentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.
		The broadcasted implementations include, but are not limited to, the following.
		  1) Relational operators (like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`; also supports precision-based relational operators);
		  2) Boolean combiner operators (like `&`, `|`, `xor()`, "not-and");
		  3) Arithmetic operators (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `pmin()`, `pmax()`);
		  4) String distance and concatenation operators;
		  5) Broadcasted S4 implementations of `ifelse()` and `vapply()`.
		The broadcasted implementations strive to minimize computation time and memory usage
		(which is not just good for computer efficiency, but also for the environment).
