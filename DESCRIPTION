Description: Implements simple broadcasted operations for atomic arrays.
    Includes relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`),
    boolean combiner operators (`&`, `|`, xor(), "not-and"),
    integer/double/complex arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` `%%`, pmin(), pmax()),
    and string concatination operators(`+` , `*`).
    The broadcasted operators have about the same performance as their non-broadcasted base 'R' counterparts.
