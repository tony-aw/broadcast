Description: Implements simple broadcasted binding and binary operations,
		for atomic and recursive arrays.
		Besides linking to 'Rcpp',
		'broadcast' does not depend on, vendor, link to, or otherwise use any external libraries;
		'broadcast' was essentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.
		The broadcasted implementations include, but are not limited to, the following.
		  1) Relational operations (like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`; can also take into account Machine precision);
		  2) Arithmetic operations (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `pmin()`, `pmax()`, integer modulo);
		  3) Boolean combiner operations (like `&`, `|`, `xor()`, "nand");
		  4) String distance, (in)equality, and concatenation operations;
		  5) A Broadcasted implementation of `ifelse()`;
		  6) A Broadcasted apply-like function;
		  7) Binding arrays along any arbitrary axis, with broadcast support.
		The broadcasted implementations strive to minimize computation time and memory usage
		(which is not just good for computer efficiency, but also for the environment).
