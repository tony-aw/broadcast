Description: Implements simple broadcasted binary operations,
    for atomic and recursive arrays.
    All operations are element-wise binary operations
    (i.e. involving only 2 arrays at a time),
    to prevent the user from accidentally exploding dimension sizes of the resulting array.
    Besides linking to 'Rcpp',
    'broadcast' does not rely on any external libraries,
    thus minimizing the number of dependencies.
    'broadcast' supports the following operators.
    1) Relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`);
    2) Boolean combiner operators (`&`, `|`, `xor()`, "not-and");
    3) Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` "intmod", `pmin()`, `pmax()`);
    4) String concatination operators (`+` , `*`);
    6) Broadcasted 'lapply' for recursive arrays;
    7) Broadcasted insertion.
    The broadcasted operations are fast and memory efficient
    (which is not just good for computer efficiency, but also for the environment).
