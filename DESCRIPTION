Description: Implements simple broadcasted operations for atomic arrays,
    and simple parallel computed operations for atomic long vectors.
    Includes relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`),
    boolean combiner operations (`&`, `|`, xor(), "not-and"),
    integer/double/complex arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` `%%`, pmin(), pmax()),
    and string concatination operators(`+` , `*`).
    The broadcasted operators have about the same performance as their base 'R' counterparts.
    The broadcasted operators use considerably less memory than their base 'R' counterparts.
