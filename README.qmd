# 🗺️Overview

The 'broadcast' package, as the name suggests, performs "broadcasting" (similar to broadcasting in the 'Numpy' module for 'Python').

In the context of operations involving 2 (or more) arrays, "broadcasting" refers to recycling arrays **without** allocating additional memory, which is considerably **faster** and **more memory-efficient** than R's regular recycling mechanism.

Please read the article "Broadcasting explained" for a more complete explanation of what "broadcasting" is.

 

At its core, the 'broadcast' package provides 3 functionalities, all 3 related to "broadcasting":

 

First, 'broadcast' provides functions for element-wise outer computations between any 2 arrays.\
These are similar to base R's `outer()` function, but using broadcasting, which is faster and more efficient than the recycling employed by `outer()`.\
The outer-like functions provided by 'broadcast' are optimised for a large set of operations, including, but not limited to, the following:

-   relational operations (like ==, !=, \<, \>, \<=, \>=, etc.);
-   arithmetic operations (like +, -, \*, /, \^, etc.);
-   Boolean combiner operations (like &, \|, xor, etc.);
-   string concatenation, string (in)equality, and string distance (Levenshtein) operations.

Note also, that base 'R' `outer()` function has some sloppy rules regarding the dimensions of the output, making it hard to predict the output shape.\
The outer-like functions provided by 'broadcast' have very strict broadcasting rules, making it easy to accurately predict the dimensions of the result.

 

Second, 'broadcast' provides the `bind_array()` function, which is an broadcasted and enhanced form of the fantastic `abind::abind()` function:

-   `bind_array()` allows for broadcasting (obviously), whereas `abind::abind()` does not.
-   `bind_array()` is significantly **faster** and uses **less memory** than `abind::abind()`.
-   `bind_array()` also differs from `abind::abind()` in that it can handle recursive arrays properly; `abind::abind()` unlists everything to atomic arrays, ruining the structure.

 

Third, 'broadcast' provides several generic functions for broadcasting:

-   `bcapply()`: a broadcasted apply-like function that works on pairs of arrays.
-   `bc_ifelse()`: a broadcasted `ifelse()` function. Broadcasts between the `yes` and `no` arguments.

 

# 🤷🏽Why use 'broadcast'

**Efficiency**

Broadcasting is faster and more memory efficient than recycling.\
This is not simply a need for speed.\
Efficient programs use less energy and resources, and is thus better for the environment.\
As a favoured language for the sciences, 'R' should not throw away an opportunity to become more efficient.

The Benchmarks show that 'broadcast' has a somewhat similar speed as equivalent operations in 'Numpy'.

 

**High Test Coverage**

The 'broadcast' package has been developed with a `set of unit tests` that have high (\> 95%) coverage.

 

**Minimal Dependencies & High Consistency**

Besides linking to 'Rcpp', 'broadcast' does not depend on, vendor, link to, include, or otherwise use any external libraries; 'broadcast' was essentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.

Not using external libraries brings a number of advantages:

-   **avoid dependency hell**: Every dependency that is added to a software package increases the likelihood of something breaking (AKA "dependency hell"). 'broadcast' thus avoids this.
-   **avoid wasting resources for translations**: Using libraries from other languages, such as 'xtensor' ('C++') or 'Numpy' ('Python') means that - at some point - one needs to convert between the structure of R to that of the other language, and vice-versa, which wastes precious time and memory. 'broadcast' requires no such translations of structures, and thus does not waste precious time and memory.
-   **ensure consistent API**: Using libraries from other languages also means one cannot always guarantee consistent behaviour of some operations. For example: both 'Numpy' and 'xtensor' have only limited support for missing values, whereas 'R' supports missing values for both atomic and recursive array/vector types (except type of 'Raw'). Since 'broadcast' does not rely on external libraries, it can ensure consistent behaviour.

 

# 🔧Installation

One can install the 'broadcast' package from GitHub like so:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/tony-aw/broadcast")
```

And attach the package - thus exposing its functions to the namespace - using:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(broadcast)
```

And one can open the introduction help page of the 'broadcast' package using any of the following:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?broadcast::broadcast
?broadcast::`broadcast-package`
?broadcast::broadcast_help
```
