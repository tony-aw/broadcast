\title{broadcast: Simple Broadcasted Operations for Atomic and Recursive Arrays with Minimal Dependencies}
\description{
broadcast: \cr
Simple Broadcasted Binding and Binary Operations for Atomic and Recursive Arrays with Minimal Dependencies. \cr \cr
Implements simple broadcasted binding and binary operations, for atomic and recursive arrays.

Besides linking to 'Rcpp', 'broadcast' does not depend on, vendor, link to, or otherwise use any external libraries;
'broadcast' was essentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.

The broadcasted implementations include, but are not limited to, the following:
\enumerate{
\item Relational operations (like \code{==}, \code{!=}, \code{<}, \code{>}, \code{<=}, \code{>=}; can also take into account Machine precision);
\item Arithmetic operations (like \code{+}, \code{-}, \code{*}, \code{/}, \code{^}, \code{pmin()}, \code{pmax()}, integer modulo);
\item Boolean combiner operations (like \code{&}, \code{|}, \code{xor()}, "nand");
\item String distance, (in)equality, and concatenation operations;
\item A Broadcasted implementation of \code{ifelse()};
\item A Broadcasted apply-like function;
\item Binding arrays along any arbitrary axis, with broadcast support.
}

The broadcasted implementations strive to minimize computation time and memory usage (which is not just good for computer efficiency, but also for the environment).

\section{Getting Started}{

An introduction and overview of the package can be found on the website. \cr

\section{Methods and Functions}{


\bold{Type Specific Binary Operations} \cr
'broadcast' provides a set of functions for type-specific binary operations
for broadcasted operations. \cr
These functions use an API similar to the \link[base]{outer} and \link[base]{sweep} functions. \cr
\cr
The following functions for type-specific binary operations are available:
\itemize{
\item \link{bc.d}: numeric arithmetic and relational operations;
\item \link{bc.b}: Boolean combiner operations;
\item \link{bc.cplx}: complex arithmetic and equality operations;
\item \link{bc.str}: string equality, concatenation, and distance operations;
\item \link{bc.list}: apply any 'R' function to 2 recursive arrays with broadcasting. \cr \cr
}

\bold{General functions} \cr
'broadcast' also comes with 2 general broadcasted functions:
\itemize{
\item \link{bc_ifelse}: Broadcasted version of \link[base]{ifelse}.
\item \link{bcapply}: Broadcasted apply-like function. \cr \cr
}

\bold{Binding Implementations} \cr
'broadcast' provides 3 binding implementations: \cr
\link{bind_mat}, \link{bind_array}, and \link{bind_dt}. \cr
\cr
\cr
\bold{Other functions} \cr
'broadcast' also provides
\link[=as_bool]{type-casting} functions,
which preserve names and dimensions - convenient for arrays. \cr \cr
