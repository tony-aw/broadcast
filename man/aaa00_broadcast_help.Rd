\description{
broadcast: \cr
Simple broadcasted binary operations for atomic and recursive arrays in 'R'. \cr
}
\details{
The 'broadcast' package provides a set of type-specific functions
for broadcasted operations. \cr
The functions use an API similar to the \link[base]{outer} and \link[base]{sweep} functions. \cr
\cr
The following functions are available:
\itemize{
\item \link{bc.num}: Broadcasted operations for numeric (types \code{int} and \code{dbl}) arrays.
\item \code{bc.bool}: Broadcasted operations for logical/Boolean arrays.
\item \code{bc.cplx}: Broadcasted operations for \code{complex} arrays.
\item \code{bc.str}: Broadcasted operations for \code{character} arrays.
\item \code{bc.list}: Broadcasted operations for recursive arrays.
}

Each of these functions support 2 types of operations:
\itemize{
\item \code{regular} operations, which return an array of the same type. \cr
For example: +, -, *, /, etc.
\item \code{relational} operations, which return a logical array. \cr
For example: ==, !=, etc.
}

The 'broadcast' package supports relational operators (==, !=, <, > <=, >=),
logical combiners (&, |, xor, nand),
arithmetic (+, -, *, /, ^)
