## broadcast: Simple Broadcasted Operations for Atomic and Recursive Arrays with Minimal Dependencies {.unnumbered}


### Description

broadcast: <br />
Simple Broadcasted Binding and Binary Operations for Atomic and Recursive Arrays with Minimal Dependencies. <br /> <br />
Implements simple broadcasted operations for atomic and recursive arrays.

Besides linking to 'Rcpp', 'broadcast' does not depend on, vendor, link to, include, or otherwise use any external libraries;
'broadcast' was essentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.

The broadcasted implementations include, but are not limited to, the following:


<ol>
<li> A more efficient and broadcasted version of <code>abind()</code>, for binding arrays along an arbitrary dimension;

</li>
<li> Relational operations (like <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>; can also take into account Machine precision);

</li>
<li> Arithmetic operations (like <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, &quot;gcd&quot;, <code>^</code>, <code>pmin()</code>, <code>pmax()</code>);

</li>
<li> Boolean combiner operations (like <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>xor()</code>, &quot;nand&quot;);

</li>
<li> String distance, (in)equality, and concatenation operations;

</li>
<li> A Broadcasted implementation of <code>ifelse()</code>;

</li>
<li> A Broadcasted apply-like function;
The broadcasted implementations strive to minimize computation time and memory usage (which is not just good for computer efficiency, but also for the environment).

</li></ol>



### Getting Started

An introduction and overview of the package can be found on the website. <br />
<br />



### Methods and Functions

<b>Outer-like functions</b> <br />
'broadcast' provides a set of functions for binary, element-wise, outer operations
with broadcasting. <br />
These functions use an API similar to the outer and sweep functions. <br />
<br />
The following functions for type-specific binary operations are available:


<ul>
<li> [bc.b](bc.b.qmd): Boolean operations;

</li>
<li> [bc.i](bc.i.qmd): integer (53bit) arithmetic and relational operations;

</li>
<li> [bc.d](bc.d.qmd): decimal (64bit) arithmetic and relational operations;

</li>
<li> [bc.cplx](bc.cplx.qmd): complex arithmetic and (in)equality operations;

</li>
<li> [bc.str](bc.str.qmd): string (in)equality, concatenation, and distance operations;

</li>
<li> [bc.list](bc.list.qmd): apply any 'R' function to 2 recursive arrays with broadcasting. <br /> <br />

</li></ul>

<b>Binding Implementations</b> <br />
'broadcast' provides 3 binding implementations: <br />
[bind_mat, bind_array, and bind_dt](bind.qmd). <br />
<br />

<b>General functions</b> <br />
'broadcast' also comes with 2 general broadcasted functions:


<ul>
<li> [bc_ifelse](bc_ifelse.qmd): Broadcasted version of ifelse.

</li>
<li> [bcapply](bcapply.qmd): Broadcasted apply-like function. <br /> <br />

</li></ul>

<b>Other functions</b> <br />
'broadcast' also provides
[type-casting](typecast.qmd) functions,
which preserve names and dimensions - convenient for arrays. <br /> <br />
