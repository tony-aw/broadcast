    "text": "Casting with equal group sizes\nSuppose you read the following matrix from a file:\n\nx &lt;- cbind(\n  id = rep(1:3, each = 2),\n  grp = rep(1:2, 3),\n  val = 1:6 * 2\n)\nprint(x)\n#&gt;      id grp val\n#&gt; [1,]  1   1   2\n#&gt; [2,]  1   2   4\n#&gt; [3,]  2   1   6\n#&gt; [4,]  2   2   8\n#&gt; [5,]  3   1  10\n#&gt; [6,]  3   2  12\n\nFor computing purposes, you may need the rows of each group - defined in column “grp” - to be cast to a new dimension.\n‘broadcast’ allows users to cast subsets of an array onto a new dimension, based on some grouping factor. In this case, the following will do the job:\n\nmargin &lt;- 1L # we cast from the rows, so margin = 1\ngrp &lt;- as.factor(x[, 2]) # factor to define which rows belongs to which group\nlevels(grp) &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\") # names for the new dimension\nout &lt;- acast(x, margin, grp) # casting is performed here\nprint(out)\n#&gt; , , a\n#&gt; \n#&gt;      id grp val\n#&gt; [1,]  1   1   2\n#&gt; [2,]  2   1   6\n#&gt; [3,]  3   1  10\n#&gt; \n#&gt; , , b\n#&gt; \n#&gt;      id grp val\n#&gt; [1,]  1   2   4\n#&gt; [2,]  2   2   8\n#&gt; [3,]  3   2  12\n\nNotice that the dimension-names of the new dimension (dimension 3) are equal to levels(grp).\nWith the cast array, one can use broadcasting to easily do things like multiply the values in each group with a different value, like so:\n\n\n# create the multiplication factor array\nmult &lt;- array(\n  1, c(1, 3, 2),\n  list(NULL, c(\"mult_id\", \"mult_grp\", \"mult_val\"), c(\"a\", \"b\"))\n)\nmult[, \"mult_val\", c(\"a\", \"b\")] &lt;- c(2, 10)\nprint(mult)\n#&gt; , , a\n#&gt; \n#&gt;      mult_id mult_grp mult_val\n#&gt; [1,]       1        1        2\n#&gt; \n#&gt; , , b\n#&gt; \n#&gt;      mult_id mult_grp mult_val\n#&gt; [1,]       1        1       10\n\nout2 &lt;- bc.num(out, mult, \"*\")\ndimnames(out2) &lt;- dimnames(out)\nprint(out2)\n#&gt; , , a\n#&gt; \n#&gt;      id grp val\n#&gt; [1,]  1   1   4\n#&gt; [2,]  2   1  12\n#&gt; [3,]  3   1  20\n#&gt; \n#&gt; , , b\n#&gt; \n#&gt;      id grp val\n#&gt; [1,]  1   2  40\n#&gt; [2,]  2   2  80\n#&gt; [3,]  3   2 120\n\nPerhaps you’d like to reverse-cast the array back when you’re done computing; reverse-casting an array can be done be combining asplit() with bind_array():\n\nasplit(out2, ndim(out2)) |&gt; bind_array(along = margin)\n#&gt;     id grp val\n#&gt; a.1  1   1   4\n#&gt; a.2  2   1  12\n#&gt; a.3  3   1  20\n#&gt; b.1  1   2  40\n#&gt; b.2  2   2  80\n#&gt; b.3  3   2 120\n\n…though the order of, in this case, the rows (because margin = 1) will not necessarily be the same as the original array."

    "text": "Casting with unequal group sizes\nThe casting arrays also works when the groups have unequal sizes, though there are a few things to keep in mind.\nLet’s start again with the input array:\n\nx &lt;- cbind(\n  id = c(rep(1:3, each = 2), 1),\n  grp = c(rep(1:2, 3), 2),\n  val = rnorm(7)\n)\nprint(x)\n#&gt;      id grp        val\n#&gt; [1,]  1   1 -1.0071209\n#&gt; [2,]  1   2 -0.6482905\n#&gt; [3,]  2   1  2.4291282\n#&gt; [4,]  2   2 -0.3344658\n#&gt; [5,]  3   1  1.6720980\n#&gt; [6,]  3   2  1.0494145\n#&gt; [7,]  1   2 -1.7425027\n\nOnce again, the acast() function can be used to cast the group subsets from the rows over a new dimension. But this time, we need to specify fill = TRUE to allow acast() to fill the gaps, otherwise an error is called.\nThus one can cast in this case like so:\n\ngrp &lt;- as.factor(x[, 2])\nlevels(grp) &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\")\nmargin &lt;- 1L\nout &lt;- acast(x, margin, grp, fill = TRUE)\nprint(out)\n#&gt; , , a\n#&gt; \n#&gt;      id grp       val\n#&gt; [1,]  1   1 -1.007121\n#&gt; [2,]  2   1  2.429128\n#&gt; [3,]  3   1  1.672098\n#&gt; [4,] NA  NA        NA\n#&gt; \n#&gt; , , b\n#&gt; \n#&gt;      id grp        val\n#&gt; [1,]  1   2 -0.6482905\n#&gt; [2,]  2   2 -0.3344658\n#&gt; [3,]  3   2  1.0494145\n#&gt; [4,]  1   2 -1.7425027\n\nNotice that some values are missing ( NA ); if some groups have unequal number of elements, acast() needs to fill the gaps with missing values.\nOnce again, we can get the original array back when we’re done like so:\n\nasplit(out, ndim(out)) |&gt; bind_array(along = margin)\n#&gt;     id grp        val\n#&gt; a.1  1   1 -1.0071209\n#&gt; a.2  2   1  2.4291282\n#&gt; a.3  3   1  1.6720980\n#&gt; a.4 NA  NA         NA\n#&gt; b.1  1   2 -0.6482905\n#&gt; b.2  2   2 -0.3344658\n#&gt; b.3  3   2  1.0494145\n#&gt; b.4  1   2 -1.7425027\n\n… but we do keep the missing values when the groups have an unequal number of elements."

These functions use an API similar to the outer() function.\nThe functions are the following:\n\nbc.b(): Broadcasted Boolean operations.\nIncludes the &, |, xor, nand, ==, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;= operations.\nbc.i() Broadcasted (53bit) Integer Numeric operations.\nIncludes relational operations, basic arithmetic, and the GCD (greatest common divisor) operation.\nbc.d(): Broadcasted (64bit) Decimal Numeric operations.\nIncludes relational operations, relational operations with Machine precision specification, and arithmetic operations.\nbc.cplx(): Broadcasted Complex Numeric operations.\nIncludes (in)equality operations, and basic arithmetic operations.\nbc.str(): Broadcasted String operations.\nIncludes operations for (in)equality, concatenation, and string distance (Levenshtein) calculation.\nbc.list(): Broadcasted operations on Recursive arrays.\n\nThese are all pair-wise functions; i.e. they operate on 2 arrays at a time.\nThis is intentional, as it is quite difficult to reason about broadcasting when it involves more than a pair of arrays.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nbc.num() is an alias for bc.d()\nbc.i(x, y \"+\") is faster and more memory efficient than bc.num(trunc(x), trunc(y), \"+\"), as the latter results in producing unnecessary copies of both x and y.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBinding implementations\n‘broadcast’ provides 3 functions for dimensional binding:\n\nbind_mat(): binds vectors and matrices row-wise or column-wise; allows for vector (i.e. linear) recycling. Returns a matrix.\nbind_array(): binds arrays (including matrices) along any arbitrary dimension; allows dimensional broadcasting. Returns an array.\nbind_dt(): binds data.frames and data.tables; allows for matching unmatched columns. Returns a data.table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe bind_dt() function is only callable if the ‘data.table’ package is also installed.\n\n\n \n\n\nAcast\nThe acast() function casts an array into a new dimension.\nRoughly speaking, it is somewhat analogous to data.table::dcast(), except that acast() works on arrays (instead of data.tables) and casts into a entirely new dimension (instead of into more columns).\n \n\n\nType-casting\n‘broadcast’ offers type-casting functions. Unlike base R’s type-casting functions (as.logical(), as.integer(), etc.), the type-casting functions from ‘broadcast’ preserve names and dimensions.\n \n\n\nSupported Structures\nThe functions in the ‘broadcast’ package only support S3 structures. S4 structures, Reference Classes, and so on are not supported."

    "text": "🗺️Overview\nThe ‘broadcast’  - package, as the name suggests, performs “broadcasting” (similar to broadcasting in the ‘Numpy’ module for ‘Python’).\nIn the context of operations involving 2 (or more) arrays, “broadcasting” refers to recycling array dimensions without allocating additional memory, which is considerably faster and more memory-efficient than R’s regular dimensions replication mechanism.\nPlease read the article “Broadcasting explained” for a more complete explanation of what “broadcasting” is.\n \nAt its core, the ‘broadcast’ package provides 3 functionalities, all 3 related to “broadcasting”:\n \nFirst, ‘broadcast’ provides functions for broadcasted element-wise binary operations between any 2 arrays. They support are optimised for a large set of relational-, arithmetic-, Boolean-, and string operations.\nThese functions have clear broadcasting rules, making it easy to accurately predict the dimensions of the result.\n \nSecond, ‘broadcast’ provides the bind_array() function, which is a broadcasted and enhanced form of the fantastic abind::abind() function:\n\nbind_array() allows for broadcasting (obviously), whereas abind::abind() does not.\nbind_array() is significantly faster and uses less memory than abind::abind().\nbind_array() also differs from abind::abind() in that it can handle recursive arrays properly; abind::abind() unlists everything to atomic arrays, ruining the structure.\n\n \nThird, ‘broadcast’ provides several generic functions for broadcasting:\n\nbcapply(): a broadcasted apply-like function that works on pairs of arrays.\nbc_ifelse(): a broadcasted ifelse() function. Broadcasts between the yes and no arguments.\n\n \nAdditionally, ‘broadcast’ includes the acast() function, for casting/pivoting an array into a new dimension. Roughly analogous to data.table::dcast(), but for arrays."

    "section": "🤷🏽Why use ‘broadcast’",
    "text": "🤷🏽Why use ‘broadcast’\nEfficiency\nBroadcasting dimensions is faster and more memory efficient than replicating dimensions.\nEfficient programs use less energy and resources, and is thus better for the environment.\nAs a favoured language for the sciences,  should not throw away an opportunity to become more efficient.\nThe Benchmarks show that ‘broadcast’ has a somewhat similar speed as equivalent operations in ‘Numpy’.\n \nConvenience\nHave you ever been bothered by any of the following while programming in :\n\nabind::abind() being too slow, saying arrays are not conformable, and/or coercing recursive arrays to character arrays?\nthat there is no built-in way to cast or pivot arrays?\nReceiving the “non-conformable arrays” error message in a simple operation when it intuitively should work?\nReceiving the “Error: cannot allocate vector of size” error message because  unnecessarily allocates too much memory?\nTrying to perform a simple operation on all possible combinations, only to find out you need nested loops and/or grid expansions to do something that should be very simple?\n\nIf you answered “YES” to any of the above, ‘broadcast’ may very well be the  - package for you.\n \nMinimal Dependencies\nBesides linking to ‘Rcpp’, ‘broadcast’ does not depend on, vendor, link to, include, or otherwise use any external libraries; ‘broadcast’ was essentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.\nNot using external libraries brings a number of advantages:\n\nAvoid dependency hell: Every dependency that is added to a software package increases the likelihood of something breaking (AKA “dependency hell”). ‘broadcast’ thus avoids this.\nAvoid wasting resources for translations: Using libraries from other languages, such as ‘xtensor’ (‘C++’) or ‘Numpy’ (‘Python’) means that - at some point - one needs to convert between the structure of  to that of the other language, and vice-versa, which wastes precious time, memory, and power. ‘broadcast’ requires no such translations of structures, and is therefore much less wasteful.\nEnsure consistent behaviour: Using libraries from other languages also means one cannot always guarantee consistent behaviour for some operations. For example: both ‘Numpy’ and ‘xtensor’ have only limited support for missing values, whereas  supports missing values for both atomic and recursive array/vector types (except type of ‘Raw’). Since ‘broadcast’ does not rely on external libraries, it can ensure behaviour that is consistent with the rest of .\n\n \nTested\nThe ‘broadcast’ package is frequently checked using a large suite of unit tests via the tinytest package. These tests have a coverage of approximately 95%. As such, the chance of a function from this package breaking is relatively low.\nSince ‘broadcast’ is still relatively new package, bugs are still very much possible. I encourage users who find bugs to report them swiftly to the GitHub page, and I will fix them as soon as time permits."

Using comnames_from = 10 will then result in bind_array() using rownames(input[[10]]) for the rownames of the output.\n\n\n\n\nrev\n\n\nBoolean, for bind_array() only.  Indicates if along should be reversed, counting backwards.  If FALSE (default), along works like normally; if TRUE, along is reversed.

This is used in case the levels of grp do not have equal frequencies, and thus additional values must be filled.  If x is atomic but not raw, missing values are filled with NA.  If x is recursive, missing values are filled with list(NULL).  If x is of type raw, uneven groupings are not supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the sake of illustration, consider a matrix x and a grouping factor grp.  Let the integer scalar k represent a group in grp, such that k \\(\\in\\) 1:nlevels(grp).  Then the code  out = acast(x, margin = 1, grp = grp)  essentially performs the following for every group k:\n\n\ncopy-paste the subset x[grp == k, ] to the subset out[, , k].\n\n\nPlease see the examples section to get a good idea on how this function casts an array.  A more detailed explanation of the acast() function can be found on the website.  \n\n\n\nAn array with the following properties:\n\n\nthe number of dimensions of the output array is equal to ndim(x) + 1;\n\n\nthe dimensions of the output array is equal to c(dim(x), max(tabulate(grp));\n\n\nthe dimnames of the output array is equal to c(dimnames(x), list(levels(grp))).  \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the casted array,  out = acast(x, margin, grp),  one can get the original x back by using  back = asplit(out, ndim(out)) |&gt; bind_array(along = margin).  Note, however, the following about the back-transformed array back:\n\n\nback will be ordered by grp along dimension margin;\n\n\nif the levels of grp did not have equal frequencies, then dim(back)[margin] &gt; dim(x)[margin], and back will have more missing values than x.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(\"broadcast\")\n\n\nx &lt;- cbind(id = c(rep(1:3, each = 2), 1), grp = c(rep(1:2, 3), 2), val = rnorm(7))\nprint(x)\n##      id grp         val\n## [1,]  1   1  0.95718432\n## [2,]  1   2 -0.19448921\n## [3,]  2   1  1.12649506\n## [4,]  2   2 -0.32827754\n## [5,]  3   1 -0.34780180\n## [6,]  3   2 -0.03469241\n## [7,]  1   2  0.87371102\n\ngrp &lt;- as.factor(x[, 2])\nlevels(grp) &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\")\nmargin &lt;- 1L\n\nacast(x, margin, grp, fill = TRUE)\n## , , a\n## \n##      id grp        val\n## [1,]  1   1  0.9571843\n## [2,]  2   1  1.1264951\n## [3,]  3   1 -0.3478018\n## [4,] NA  NA         NA\n## \n## , , b\n## \n##      id grp         val\n## [1,]  1   2 -0.19448921\n## [2,]  2   2 -0.32827754\n## [3,]  3   2 -0.03469241\n## [4,]  1   2  0.87371102"

    "text": "Alternatives to ‘broadcast’\nAt the time of writing, the only alternative to the ‘broadcast’ package with respect to having a large range of support for broadcasting, is using an  package that allows access to an external library from another programming language that does support ‘broadcasting’.\nFor example: Using the ‘reticulate’ package to access ‘Python’, and via that connection accessing the ‘Numpy’ module, which supports (and perhaps even had the first implementation) of broadcasting.\nAnother example is the ‘xtensor’ package (and extensiosn to that package, like ‘rray’), that allows  - users to access the ‘C++’ module of the same name.\nThese alternatives all need access to a different programming language, which brings with it a host of problems:\n\nDependency hell: Every dependency that is added to a software package increases the likelihood of something breaking (AKA “dependency hell”).\nWasteful translations: Using libraries from other languages, such as ‘xtensor’ (‘C++’) or ‘Numpy’ (‘Python’) means that - at some point - one needs to convert between the structure of  to that of the other language, and vice-versa, which wastes precious time, memory, and power.\nInconsistent behaviour: Using libraries from other languages also means one cannot always guarantee consistent behaviour for some operations.\nFor example: both ‘Numpy’ and ‘xtensor’ have only limited support for missing values, whereas  supports missing values for both atomic and recursive array/vector types (except type of ‘Raw’).\n\nSince the ‘broadcast’ package does not rely on any external library, other than linking to ‘Rcpp’, ‘broadcast’ avoids all of the above issues.\n \n\n\nComplimentary packages\nThe ‘broadcast’ fits well with the squarebrackets package, though that package is currently experimental, at the time of writing.\n \n\n\nThe tinyverse\nThe ‘broadcast’ package adheres to the ‘tinyverse’ philosophy (not to be confused with the ‘tidyverse’), which is the programming philosophy to primarily minimize dependencies, and secondarily to keep code efficient.\nOther  packages that share this philosophy include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nthe core fastverse packages: ‘data.table’, ‘collapse’, and ‘kit’.\nstringi, the primary  package for string processing.\ntinycodet, for functions to help in coding etiquette.\ntinytable, for flexible table creation.\ntinyplot, for plotting graphs; much faster than, for example, ‘ggplot2’, and with zero dependencies.\ntinytest, for unit testing. Unlike ‘testthat’, ‘tinytest’ has zero dependencies.\nmatrixStats, for computing across rows or columns of matrices.\nand many others."

    "section": "🗺️Overview",
    "text": "🗺️Overview\nThe ‘broadcast’  - package, as the name suggests, performs “broadcasting” (similar to broadcasting in the ‘Numpy’ module for ‘Python’).\nIn the context of operations involving 2 (or more) arrays, “broadcasting” refers to recycling array dimensions without allocating additional memory, which is considerably faster and more memory-efficient than R’s regular dimensions replication mechanism.\nPlease read the article “Broadcasting explained” for a more complete explanation of what “broadcasting” is.\n \nAt its core, the ‘broadcast’ package provides 3 functionalities, all 3 related to “broadcasting”:\n \nFirst, ‘broadcast’ provides functions for broadcasted element-wise binary operations between any 2 arrays. They support are optimised for a large set of relational-, arithmetic-, Boolean-, and string operations.\nThese functions have clear broadcasting rules, making it easy to accurately predict the dimensions of the result.\n \nSecond, ‘broadcast’ provides the bind_array() function, which is a broadcasted and enhanced form of the fantastic abind::abind() function:\n\nbind_array() allows for broadcasting (obviously), whereas abind::abind() does not.\nbind_array() is significantly faster and uses less memory than abind::abind().\nbind_array() also differs from abind::abind() in that it can handle recursive arrays properly; abind::abind() unlists everything to atomic arrays, ruining the structure.\n\n \nThird, ‘broadcast’ provides several generic functions for broadcasting:\n\nbcapply(): a broadcasted apply-like function that works on pairs of arrays.\nbc_ifelse(): a broadcasted ifelse() function. Broadcasts between the yes and no arguments.\n\n \nAdditionally, ‘broadcast’ includes the acast() function, for casting/pivoting an array into a new dimension. Roughly analogous to data.table::dcast(), but for arrays."

    "section": "🤷🏽Why use ‘broadcast’",
    "text": "🤷🏽Why use ‘broadcast’\nEfficiency\nBroadcasting dimensions is faster and more memory efficient than replicating dimensions.\nEfficient programs use less energy and resources, and is thus better for the environment.\nAs a favoured language for the sciences,  should not throw away an opportunity to become more efficient.\nThe Benchmarks show that ‘broadcast’ has a somewhat similar speed as equivalent operations in ‘Numpy’.\n \nConvenience\nHave you ever been bothered by any of the following while programming in :\n\nabind::abind() being too slow, saying arrays are not conformable, and/or coercing recursive arrays to character arrays?\nthat there is no built-in way to cast or pivot arrays?\nReceiving the “non-conformable arrays” error message in a simple operation when it intuitively should work?\nReceiving the “Error: cannot allocate vector of size” error message because  unnecessarily allocates too much memory?\nTrying to perform a simple operation on all possible combinations, only to find out you need nested loops and/or grid expansions to do something that should be very simple?\n\nIf you answered “YES” to any of the above, ‘broadcast’ may very well be the  - package for you.\n \nMinimal Dependencies\nBesides linking to ‘Rcpp’, ‘broadcast’ does not depend on, vendor, link to, include, or otherwise use any external libraries; ‘broadcast’ was essentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.\nNot using external libraries brings a number of advantages:\n\nAvoid dependency hell: Every dependency that is added to a software package increases the likelihood of something breaking (AKA “dependency hell”). ‘broadcast’ thus avoids this.\nAvoid wasting resources for translations: Using libraries from other languages, such as ‘xtensor’ (‘C++’) or ‘Numpy’ (‘Python’) means that - at some point - one needs to convert between the structure of  to that of the other language, and vice-versa, which wastes precious time, memory, and power. ‘broadcast’ requires no such translations of structures, and is therefore much less wasteful.\nEnsure consistent behaviour: Using libraries from other languages also means one cannot always guarantee consistent behaviour for some operations. For example: both ‘Numpy’ and ‘xtensor’ have only limited support for missing values, whereas  supports missing values for both atomic and recursive array/vector types (except type of ‘Raw’). Since ‘broadcast’ does not rely on external libraries, it can ensure behaviour that is consistent with the rest of .\n\n \nTested\nThe ‘broadcast’ package is frequently checked using a large suite of unit tests via the tinytest package. These tests have a coverage of approximately 95%. As such, the chance of a function from this package breaking is relatively low.\nSince ‘broadcast’ is still relatively new package, bugs are still very much possible. I encourage users who find bugs to report them swiftly to the GitHub page, and I will fix them as soon as time permits."

Instead, in base  we need to replicate (and thus copy) the array dimensions.

    "text": "2.2 What is the problem?\nThere are several problems.\nFirst and foremost, when the arrays become larger, the replicated arrays become larger, and if the arrays become too large, you may require more memory than is available in your current system, resulting in a message like the following:\n\n&gt; Error: cannot allocate vector of size\n\nThe problem isn’t limited to available memory. As the required memory to allocate increase, the speed decreases. And let’s not forget that computational inefficiency in general is also bad for the environment.\nAdditionally, a solution like x + y[rep(1L, 4L),] is not easily scalable for other arrays when the dimensions are not known a-priori."

    "text": "2.3 Introducing Broadcasting\nIn an operation like x + y[rep(1L, 4L),], y is replicated to become the same size. The thing is, physical replication - and thus copying - of the dimensions of an array should not be necessary; arrays only need to be recycled virtually.\nVirtual recycling does not actually physically replicate arrays. Instead, nested loops in ‘C’ and ‘C++’ are used to simulate a recycled array.\nThis is similar to how  recycles regular (i.e. dimensionless) vectors.\nVirtual recycling requires no additional memory (apart from allocating the final end result); it is much faster and much more memory efficient than replicating dimensions.\nAnd that is what broadcasting does: broadcasting provides fast virtual recycling of array dimensions in the context of element-wise operations involving 2 (or more) arrays without allocating additional memory.\nIn the earlier example, we used:\n\nx + y[rep(1L, 4L),]\n#&gt;      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n#&gt; [1,]   11   25   39   53   67\n#&gt; [2,]   12   26   40   54   68\n#&gt; [3,]   13   27   41   55   69\n#&gt; [4,]   14   28   42   56   70\n\nTo compute the element-wise addition using broadcasting through the ‘broadcast’ package, we can do the following:\n\nlibrary(broadcast)\n\nbc.num(x, y, \"+\")\n#&gt;      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n#&gt; [1,]   11   25   39   53   67\n#&gt; [2,]   12   26   40   54   68\n#&gt; [3,]   13   27   41   55   69\n#&gt; [4,]   14   28   42   56   70\n\nThe result is the same (as it should). But as the size of the resulting array increases, the broadcasted functions become more and more efficient in terms of both speed and memory, in comparison with base  approaches.\nTechnically, one can also use t(t(x) + drop(y)), but that has a similar problem: one needs to perform transposition twice, which makes unnecessary copies, is slow, and is - again - not scalable to arrays where the dimensions are not known a-priori.\nBenchmarks can be found on the website."

This computation is repeated 200 times. From these 200 benchmarks, the median, first quartile, and third quartiles are taken.

    "text": "Keeping comparisons (somewhat) fair\nTo keep the comparisons between ‘broadcast’ and ‘Numpy’+‘reticulate’ fair, a number of measures have been taken:\n\nDistributions of benchmarks tend to be heavily skewed. Therefore, the median measure (together with the quartiles) are taken.\nconversion from Numpy to ‘R’ is DISABLED; this allows for comparing the speed more fairly. When conversion would be enabled, precious time would be wasted to convert from Numpy structures to comparable ‘R’ structures.\ngarbage collection is disabled in reticulate’s Python. In , only benchmarks with no garbage collection, or level 0 garbage collection, are used. I feel this keeps the comparisons relatively fair (but it’s not perfect).\nSince only benchmarks with no garbage collection, or level 0 garbage collection, are used for , a check is made that at least 100 benchmark measurements are kept in (out 200 in total).\nIn relation to the previous point, note that the quantiles and the median (the median itself is simply the 50% quantile) are asymptotically independent of sample-size (unlike, for example, the variance, which is affected by sample size).\n‘R’ has more support for missing values than ‘Numpy’, which also leads to a difference in speed. But both ‘R’ and ‘Numpy’ handle missing values equally in decimal numbers ( 64bit floats in Numpy and 64bit doubles in ‘R’ ), through the NaN construct. Therefore, only operations on decimal numbers are compared.\nOperations like power (^) and division (/) need to handle special cases (like when the right-hand side of the operation is 0). I cannot guarantee that ‘broadcast’ and ‘Numpy’ will handle these special cases in the exact same way. The plus (+) operator, however, has no such special cases. Therefore, the comparisons on this page involve only summation."
