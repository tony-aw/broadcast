# Compiled code

'broadcast' links to the fantastic [Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp) package.  
Besides linking to the aforementioned 'Rcpp', no code from external libraries (like 'Numpy' or 'xtensor') were used in any way whatsoever; the 'C' and 'C++' code in the 'broadcast' package was essentially made entirely from scratch.

# Site resources

The website itself was put together using 'Quarto' (out-of-the-box website producing packages, such as 'pkgdown' and 'altdoc', were not used).

Most graphs on the website were created using the [tinyplot](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/tinyplot) package, and all tables were created using the [tinytable](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/tinytable) package.  
The special characters (such as `r fa("r-project")`) were created using the [fontawesome](https://github.com/rstudio/fontawesome/) package.
