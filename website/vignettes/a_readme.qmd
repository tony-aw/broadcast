# Introduction

&nbsp;

## 🗺️Overview

The 'broadcast' 'R'-package, as the name suggests, performs "broadcasting" (similar to broadcasting in the 'Numpy' module for 'Python').

In the context of operations involving 2 (or more) arrays, "broadcasting" refers to recycling array dimensions **without** allocating additional memory, which is considerably **faster** and **more memory-efficient** than R's regular dimensions repetition mechanism.

Please read the article "Broadcasting explained" for a more complete explanation of what "broadcasting" is.

&nbsp;

At its core, the 'broadcast' package provides 3 functionalities, all 3 related to "broadcasting":

&nbsp;

First, 'broadcast' provides functions for element-wise outer computations between any 2 arrays.  
These are similar to base R's `outer()` function, but using broadcasting, which is faster and more efficient than the mechanism employed by `outer()`.  
The outer-like functions provided by 'broadcast' are optimised for a large set of operations, including, but not limited to, the following:

-   relational operations (like ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, etc.);
-   arithmetic operations (like +, -, *, /, ^, etc.);
-   Boolean combiner operations (like &, |, xor, etc.);
-   string concatenation, string (in)equality, and string distance (Levenshtein) operations.

Base 'R' `outer()` function has some sloppy rules regarding the dimensions of the output, making it hard to predict the output shape.  
The outer-like functions provided by 'broadcast' have very strict broadcasting rules, making it easy to accurately predict the dimensions of the result.

&nbsp;

Second, 'broadcast' provides the `bind_array()` function, which is an broadcasted and enhanced form of the fantastic `abind::abind()` function:

-   `bind_array()` allows for broadcasting (obviously), whereas `abind::abind()` does not.
-   `bind_array()` is significantly **faster** and uses **less memory** than `abind::abind()`.
-   `bind_array()` also differs from `abind::abind()` in that it can handle recursive arrays properly; `abind::abind()` unlists everything to atomic arrays, ruining the structure.

&nbsp;

Third, 'broadcast' provides several generic functions for broadcasting:

-   `bcapply()`: a broadcasted apply-like function that works on pairs of arrays.
-   `bc_ifelse()`: a broadcasted `ifelse()` function. Broadcasts between the `yes` and `no` arguments.

&nbsp;

## 🤷🏽Why use 'broadcast'

**Efficiency**

Broadcasting dimensions is faster and more memory efficient than repeating dimensions.  
This is not simply a need for speed.  
Efficient programs use less energy and resources, and is thus better for the environment.  
As a favoured language for the sciences, 'R' should not throw away an opportunity to become more efficient.

The `Benchmarks` show that 'broadcast' has a somewhat similar speed as equivalent operations in 'Numpy'.

&nbsp;

**Convenience**

Broadcasting can make many applications much easier to write.  
For Example: Suppose you want to compute some metric on all possible pair-wise combinations of the elements of 2 vectors.  
You *could* write slow and ugly nested for-loops...  
But you can instead also make the vectors orthogonal, and perform the broadcasting computation on the 2 orthogonal vectors.  
The broadcasted method runs **much** faster, is faster to type, and easier to reason about, than using the clumsy nested for-loops.  
For more practical examples, see `Examples of Practical Applictaions`.

&nbsp;


**Minimal Dependencies**

Besides linking to 'Rcpp', 'broadcast' does not depend on, vendor, link to, include, or otherwise use any external libraries; 'broadcast' was essentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.

Not using external libraries brings a number of advantages:

 - **Avoid dependency hell**: Every dependency that is added to a software package increases the likelihood of something breaking (AKA "dependency hell"). 'broadcast' thus avoids this.
 - **Avoid wasting resources for translations**: Using libraries from other languages, such as 'xtensor' ('C++') or 'Numpy' ('Python') means that - at some point - one needs to convert between the structure of R to that of the other language, and vice-versa, which wastes precious time and memory. 'broadcast' requires no such translations of structures, and thus does not waste precious time and memory.
 - **Ensure consistent behaviour**: Using libraries from other languages also means one cannot always guarantee consistent behaviour of some operations. For example: both 'Numpy' and 'xtensor' have only limited support for missing values, whereas 'R' supports missing values for both atomic and recursive array/vector types (except type of 'Raw'). Since 'broadcast' does not rely on external libraries, it can ensure consistent behaviour.
