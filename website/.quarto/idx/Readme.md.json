Broadcasts between\n  the `yes` and `no` arguments.\n\n \n\n## 🤷🏽Why use ‘broadcast’\n\n**Efficiency**\n\nBroadcasting dimensions is faster and more memory efficient than\nrepeating dimensions.  \nThis is not simply a need for speed.  \nEfficient programs use less energy and resources, and is thus better for\nthe environment.  \nAs a favoured language for the sciences, ‘R’ should not throw away an\nopportunity to become more efficient.\n\nThe `Benchmarks` show that ‘broadcast’ has a somewhat similar speed as\nequivalent operations in ‘Numpy’.\n\n \n\n**Convenience**\n\nBroadcasting can make many applications much easier to write.  \nFor Example: Suppose you want to compute some metric on all possible\npair-wise combinations of the elements of 2 vectors.  \nYou *could* write slow and ugly nested for-loops…  \nBut you can instead also make the vectors orthogonal, and perform the\nbroadcasting computation on the 2 orthogonal vectors.  \nThe broadcasted method runs **much** faster, is faster to type, and\neasier to reason about, than using the clumsy nested for-loops.  \nFor more practical examples, see `Examples of Practical Applictaions`.\n\n \n\n**Minimal Dependencies**\n\nBesides linking to ‘Rcpp’, ‘broadcast’ does not depend on, vendor, link\nto, include, or otherwise use any external libraries; ‘broadcast’ was\nessentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.\n\nNot using external libraries brings a number of advantages:\n\n- **Avoid dependency hell**: Every dependency that is added to a\n  software package increases the likelihood of something breaking (AKA\n  “dependency hell”). ‘broadcast’ thus avoids this.\n- **Avoid wasting resources for translations**: Using libraries from\n  other languages, such as ‘xtensor’ (‘C++’) or ‘Numpy’ (‘Python’) means\n  that - at some point - one needs to convert between the structure of R\n  to that of the other language, and vice-versa, which wastes precious\n  time and memory. ‘broadcast’ requires no such translations of\n  structures, and thus does not waste precious time and memory.\n- **Ensure consistent behaviour**: Using libraries from other languages\n  also means one cannot always guarantee consistent behaviour of some\n  operations. For example: both ‘Numpy’ and ‘xtensor’ have only limited\n  support for missing values, whereas ‘R’ supports missing values for\n  both atomic and recursive array/vector types (except type of ‘Raw’).\n  Since ‘broadcast’ does not rely on external libraries, it can ensure\n  consistent behaviour.\n\n \n\n## 📖Documentation\n\nThe documentation in the ‘broadcast’ website is divided into 3 main\nnavigationable sections:\n\n- Guides and Vignettes: Here you’ll find the topic-oriented guides in\n  the form of a few Vignettes.\n- Reference Manual: Here you’ll find the function-oriented reference\n  manual.\n- About: Here you’ll find mainly the Changelog and License file.\n\n
