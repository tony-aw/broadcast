Broadcasts between the `yes` and `no` arguments.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## ü§∑üèΩWhy use 'broadcast'\n\n**Efficiency**\n\nBroadcasting dimensions is faster and more memory efficient than repeating dimensions.  \nThis is not simply a need for speed.  \nEfficient programs use less energy and resources, and is thus better for the environment.  \nAs a favoured language for the sciences, 'R' should not throw away an opportunity to become more efficient.\n\nThe `Benchmarks` show that 'broadcast' has a somewhat similar speed as equivalent operations in 'Numpy'.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Convenience**\n\nBroadcasting can make many applications much easier to write.  \nFor Example: Suppose you want to compute some metric on all possible pair-wise combinations of the elements of 2 vectors.  \nYou *could* write slow and ugly nested for-loops...  \nBut you can instead also make the vectors orthogonal, and perform the broadcasting computation on the 2 orthogonal vectors.  \nThe broadcasted method runs **much** faster, is faster to type, and easier to reason about, than using the clumsy nested for-loops.  \nFor more practical examples, see `Examples of Practical Applictaions`.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Minimal Dependencies**\n\nBesides linking to 'Rcpp', 'broadcast' does not depend on, vendor, link to, include, or otherwise use any external libraries; 'broadcast' was essentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.\n\nNot using external libraries brings a number of advantages:\n\n - **Avoid dependency hell**: Every dependency that is added to a software package increases the likelihood of something breaking (AKA \"dependency hell\"). 'broadcast' thus avoids this.\n - **Avoid wasting resources for translations**: Using libraries from other languages, such as 'xtensor' ('C++') or 'Numpy' ('Python') means that - at some point - one needs to convert between the structure of R to that of the other language, and vice-versa, which wastes precious time and memory. 'broadcast' requires no such translations of structures, and thus does not waste precious time and memory.\n - **Ensure consistent behaviour**: Using libraries from other languages also means one cannot always guarantee consistent behaviour of some operations. For example: both 'Numpy' and 'xtensor' have only limited support for missing values, whereas 'R' supports missing values for both atomic and recursive array/vector types (except type of 'Raw'). Since 'broadcast' does not rely on external libraries, it can ensure consistent behaviour.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## üìñDocumentation\n\nThe documentation in the 'broadcast' website is divided into 3 main navigationable sections:\n\n - Guides and Vignettes: Here you'll find the topic-oriented guides in the form of a few Vignettes.\n - Reference Manual: Here you'll find the function-oriented reference manual.\n - About: Here you'll find mainly the Changelog and License
