[bind_array()](/man/bind_array.qmd) does support broadcasting.\n - `abind()` does not support recursive arrays (i.e. arrays of type `list`). When binding recursive arrays, `abind()` will attempt to unlist it, even when it does not make sense, ruining the structure of the array. [bind_array()](/man/bind_array.qmd) fully supports recursive arrays, as well as arrays of all atomic types.\n - `abind()` has somewhat confusing mechanisms for giving dimension names to the output. [bind_array()](/man/bind_array.qmd) has more streamlined naming arguments.\n\n\n[bind_array()](/man/bind_array.qmd) uses a similar API to that of `abind::abind()`, and provides similar features like binding arrays before the first dimension (using `along = 0`) or after the last dimension.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Generic Broadcasted functions\n\n'broadcast' provides [bcapply()](/man/bcapply.qmd), which is a broadcasted apply-like function, and [bc_ifelse()](/man/bc_ifelse.qmd), which is a broadcasted version of `ifelse()`.\n\n&nsbp;\n\n# Acast\n\nThe [acast()](/man/acast.qmd) function casts an array into a new dimension.  \nRoughly speaking, it is somewhat analogous to `data.table::dcast()`, except that [acast()](/man/acast.qmd) works on arrays (instead of data.tables) and casts into a entirely new dimension (instead of into more columns).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Type-casting\n\n'broadcast' offers type-casting functions.
