They support a large set of relational-, arithmetic-, Boolean-, and string operations.\\\nThese functions have clear broadcasting rules, making it easy to accurately predict the dimensions of the result.\n\n¬†\n\nSecond, 'broadcast' provides the [bind_array()](/man/bind.qmd) function, which is a broadcasted and enhanced form of the fantastic `abind::abind()` function:\n\n-   [bind_array()](/man/bind.qmd) allows for broadcasting (obviously), whereas `abind::abind()` does not.\n-   [bind_array()](/man/bind.qmd) is significantly **faster** and uses **less memory** than `abind::abind()`.\n-   [bind_array()](/man/bind.qmd) also differs from `abind::abind()` in that it can handle recursive arrays properly; `abind::abind()` unlists everything to atomic arrays, ruining the structure.\n\n¬†\n\nThird, 'broadcast' provides several generic functions for broadcasting:\n\n-   [bcapply()](/man/bcapply.qmd): a broadcasted apply-like function that works on pairs of arrays.\n-   [bc_ifelse()](/man/bc_ifelse.qmd): a broadcasted `ifelse()` function. Broadcasts between the `yes` and `no` arguments.\n\n¬†\n\nAdditionally, 'broadcast' includes the [acast()](/man/acast.qmd) function, for casting/pivoting an array into a new dimension. Roughly analogous to `data.table::dcast()`, but for arrays.\n\n¬†\n\n## ü§∑üèΩWhy use 'broadcast'\n\n**Efficiency**\n\nBroadcasting dimensions is faster and more memory efficient than replicating dimensions.\\\nEfficient programs use less energy and resources, and is thus better for the environment.\\\nAs a favoured language for the sciences, `r fa(\"r-project\")` should not throw away an opportunity to become more efficient.\n\nThe `Benchmarks` show that 'broadcast' has a somewhat similar speed as equivalent operations in 'Numpy'.\n\n¬†\n\n**Convenience**\n\nHave you ever been bothered by any of the following while programming in `r fa(\"r-project\")`:\n\n-   `abind::abind()` being too slow, saying arrays are not conformable, and/or coercing recursive arrays to character arrays?\n-   that there is no built-in way to cast or pivot arrays?\n-   Receiving the \"non-conformable arrays\" error message in a simple operation when it intuitively should work?\n-   Receiving the \"Error: cannot allocate vector of size\" error message because `r fa(\"r-project\")` unnecessarily allocates too much memory?\n-   Trying to perform a simple operation on all possible combinations, only to find out you need nested loops and/or grid expansions to do something that should be *very* simple?\n\nIf you answered \"YES\" to any of the above, 'broadcast' may very well be the `r fa(\"r-project\")` - package for you.\n\n¬†\n\n**Minimal Dependencies**\n\nBesides linking to 'Rcpp', 'broadcast' does not depend on, vendor, link to, include, or otherwise use any external libraries; 'broadcast' was essentially made from scratch and can be installed out-of-the-box.\n\nNot using external libraries brings a number of advantages:\n\n-   **Avoid dependency hell**: Every dependency that is added to a software package increases the likelihood of something breaking (AKA \"dependency hell\"). 'broadcast' thus avoids this.\n-   **Avoid wasting resources for translations**: Using libraries from other languages, such as 'xtensor' ('C++') or 'Numpy' ('Python') means that - at some point - one needs to convert between the structure of `r fa(\"r-project\")` to that of the other language, and vice-versa, which wastes precious time, memory, and power. 'broadcast' requires no such translations of structures, and is therefore much less wasteful.\n-   **Ensure consistent behaviour**: Using libraries from other languages also means one cannot always guarantee consistent behaviour for some operations. For example: both 'Numpy' and 'xtensor' have only limited support for missing values, whereas `r fa(\"r-project\")` supports missing values for both atomic and recursive array/vector types (except type of 'Raw'). Since 'broadcast' does not rely on external libraries, it can ensure behaviour that is consistent with the rest of `r fa(\"r-project\")`.\n\n¬†\n\n**Tested**\n\nThe 'broadcast' package is frequently checked using a large suite of unit tests via the [tinytest](https://github.com/markvanderloo/tinytest) package. These tests have a coverage of approximately 95%. As such, the chance of a function from this package breaking is relatively low.\n\nSince 'broadcast' is still relatively new package, bugs are still very much possible. I encourage users who find bugs to report them swiftly to the GitHub page, and I will fix them as soon as time permits.\n\n¬†\n\n## üöÄQuick Example\n\nConsider the matrices `x` and `y`:\n\n```{r}\nx <- array(1:20, c(4, 5))\ny <- array(1:5*10, c(1, 5))\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\n```\n\nSuppose one wishes to compute the element-wise addition of these 2 arrays.\n\nThis won't work in base `r fa(\"r-project\")`:\n\n```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}\nx + y\nError in x + y : non-conformable arrays\n```\n\nWhen computing the element-wise sum of these arrays, they both need to be recycled to equal size in order to compute the element-wise computation.\\\nI.e. `y` needs its single row to be recycled 4 times, creating 2 conformable matrices.\n\nYou *could* do the following....\n\n```{r}\nx + y[rep(1L, 4L),]\n```\n\n... but this involves replicating/copying `y` several times, which costs memory, reduces speed, and the code is not easily scalable for arrays with different dimensions.\n\nThe 'broadcast' package performs \"broadcasting\", which can do the above, but **faster**, **without unnecessary copies**, and scalable to arrays of any size (up to 16 dimensions), like so:\n\n```{r}\nbc.num(x, y, \"+\")\n```\n\n¬†\n\n## üìñDocumentation\n\nThe documentation in the 'broadcast' website is divided into 3 main parts:\n\n-   Guides and Vignettes: contains the topic-oriented guides in the form of a few Vignettes.\n-   Reference Manual: contains the function-oriented reference manual.\n-   About: Contains the Acknowledgements, Change logs and License file. Here you'll also find some information regarding the relationship between 'broadcast' and other `r fa(\"r-project\")` packages\n\n¬†
