all other operators are called \"regularly\", somewhat (but not entirely) similar as functions would be called in an `apply()`-like function.  \nThe outer-like functions provided by 'broadcast', however, come with a very large set of optimised operators, written and compiled in 'C' and 'C++'.\n\nThird, where base 'R' provides a single `outer()` function, 'broadcast' provides several outer-like functions.  \nThis is done for the following reasons:\n\n - As stated earlier, the outer-like functions provided by 'broadcast' come with a very large set of pre-compiled, optimised operations.  \n Fitting all of those operators into a single outer-like function would be inefficient, and would also make it easy for the user to lose track of all of the supported operators.\n - Splitting the numeric-ish operations into Boolean, (53bit) Integer, and (64bit) Decimal numbers, allows for only performing typecasting when necessary; more importantly, typecasting here is performed at the 'C' level, without allocating an entirely new vector/array.  \n This allows for far more efficient code.  \n For example: `bc.i(x, y \"+\")` is significantly faster and more memory efficient than `bc.d(trunc(x), trunc(y), \"+\")`, as the latter results in producing unnecessary copies of both `x` and `y`.\n\nFinally, much like the `outer()` function from base 'R', the outer-like functions provided by 'broadcast', are pair-wise functions; i.e. they operate on 2 arrays at a time.  \nThis is intentional, as it is quite difficult to reason about broadcasting when it involves more than a pair of arrays.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n [[[`bc.num()`](/man/bc.d.qmd)](/man/bc.d.qmd)](/man/bc.d.qmd) is an alias for [[[`bc.d()`](/man/bc.d.qmd)](/man/bc.d.qmd)](/man/bc.d.qmd).\n\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor details on the operators supported in each of the outer-like functions, please refer to the relevant sections in the Reference Manual.\n\n  \n \n&nbsp;\n\n# Binding implementations\n\n'broadcast' provides 3 functions for dimensional binding:\n\n - [[[`bind_mat()`](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd): binds vectors and matrices row-wise or column-wise; allows for vector (i.e. linear) recycling.\n - [[[`bind_array()`](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd): binds arrays (including matrices) along any arbitrary dimension; allows dimensional broadcasting.\n - [[[`bind_dt()`](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd): binds data.frames and data.tables; allows for matching unmatched columns.\n \nNote that the naming convention of the binding implementations here is\n\"bind_\" followed by the **resulting class** (abbreviated) - i.e. ...\n\n - [[[`bind_mat()`](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd) **returns** a matrix, but can bind both matrices and vectors.\n - [[[`bind_array()`](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd) **returns** an array, but can bind both arrays and matrices.\n - [[[`bind_dt()`](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd) **returns** a data.table, but can bind not only data.tables, but also most other data.frame-like objects.\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\nThe [[[`bind_dt()`](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd)](/man/bind.qmd) function is only callable if the 'data.table' package is also installed.\n\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",
