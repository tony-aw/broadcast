Compilation of the package may therefore be slow on some operating systems, especially Linux systems; please be patient. On an average laptop running Windows 11, installation may only take about 2 minutes.\n\nIf installation is too slow, one may try to speed up the installation using multi-threading, for example like so:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\nnthreads <- 8L # specify number of threads\nSys.setenv(MAKEFLAGS = paste0(\"-j\", nthreads)) # may speed up installation\n\nremotes::install_github(\"https://github.com/tony-aw/broadcast\")\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo attach the package - thus expose its functions to the namespace - please use the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\nlibrary(broadcast)\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo open the introduction help page of the ‘broadcast’ package, please use any of the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\n?broadcast::broadcast\n?broadcast::broadcast_help\n?broadcast::`broadcast-package`\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n",
